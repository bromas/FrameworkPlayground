### Framework Playground
A project for playing with design patterns and frameworks.

#### Running this Project
Dependencies are managed via [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), but I have included them under source control so you can simply clone this repo and run the project.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bromas/FrameworkPlayground.git
```

Requires Xcode 6.3/Swift 1.2.
